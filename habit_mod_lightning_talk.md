Habit Modification in 5
=======================

*"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."*
*- Aristotle*

# What is a habit?

+ Habits are comprised of three parts:
	- Trigger
	- Routine
	- Reward

## Triggers

+ A trigger is any stimuli that signals to the brain to perform a 'routine'.
+ For example, downing your beverage can signal that dinner is done and it's time to wash your dish.
+ Triggers are important because identifying them can help you break bad habits.

## Routine

+ The actual habit being performed.
+ For example, smoking a cigarette

# Microhabits

+ Little itty bitty habits that are practically impossible not to do.
+ For example, 5 zen breaths.

# Keystone Habits

+ Habits that can be built upon by acting as triggers for other habits.
+ For example, waking up early.
+ String habits together:
	- Wake up early
	- Brush teeth
	- Do 10 push ups
	- Do 20 squats
	- Write 250 words
+ One keystone habit can facilitate many child-habits

Challenge:
Find one habit you'd like to build in your life. Identify a microhabit that could be used to begin developing that habit. Do that microhabit for five days. Tweet @JustUseAPen if it works, or if it doesn't.
